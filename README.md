# colepawfig

This is my personal Team Fortress 2 config built for maximum visibility, competitive integrity, and stability in mind.

**NOTE:** This config is completely reliant on [Mastercomfig](https://mastercomfig.com), [Mastercomfigs settings](cfg/overrides/modules.cfg), my [autoexec.cfg](cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg), and my [launch options](cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg#L19), as they include the resolution, optimizations, and security focused Launch Arguments.

**Regarding Casual:** I have literally no idea what works and what doesn't with my config, be it mods or settings. Test it yourself.

## Features
* Maximized visibility with the use of Phong shading, Specular mapping, Bumpmaps, Lightwarps, Rimlighting, Player shadows, High Character LOD, and High Character Texture Quality, along with a larger, more visible overheal particle
* Removed distractions such as shell casings, tracers, dominations, custom decals, noisemakers, halloween souls, gibs, explosions, festivizers, and zombie skins
* Flat textures
* Useful scripts for hiding the viewmodel, turning off chat, and other class specific scripts
* Comments on every command and setting describing how it affects TF2
* My custom m0rehud, focused on quick absorbtion of information, and visibility
* Disabled custom decals, sprays, and the ability to view items custom names and descriptions
