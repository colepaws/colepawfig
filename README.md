# colepawfig

This is my personal Team Fortress 2 config built for maximum visibility, competitive integrity, and stability in mind.

**NOTE:** This config is completely reliant on [Mastercomfig](https://mastercomfig.com), [Mastercomfigs settings](cfg/overrides/modules.cfg), my [autoexec.cfg](cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg), and my [launch options](cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg#L19), as they include the resolution, optimizations, and security focused Launch Arguments. I also use -dxlevel 81.

**Regarding the [config.cfg:](cfg/config.cfg)** This is probably going to have settings that change per commit, and that's not something to worry about. Loading in game will change and correctly set any values that might get all messed up, since my [autoexec.cfg](cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg) does that.

**Regarding Casual:** I have literally no idea what works and what doesn't with my config, be it mods or settings. I don't play casual so I'm not going to test anything, but be my guest.

## Q&A

### It looks awful! Why do you play like this?
Growing up, I had a really, really bad laptop that could barely run TF2, specifically a [Lenovo Yoga 900](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-yoga-900-1307062/review/2). I had to lower basically all of my settings to get it to even break 60fps, and even then that was cutting it close. That means crunchy graphics and all. Pretty grim right? I got so used to those settings that playing with anything else just feels extremely strange and off putting.

### No stretched res?
I completely understand the hype for stretched res. "Wider" models, everyone and their mother is using it, so why not? First of all, I didn't grow up on 4:3 (and neither did 99% of people using stretched res these days), so it feels very weird to me. Secondly, your horizontal FOV is smaller and can result in missing information other players can see. And third, using 4:3 stretched results in a difference in the way your mouse moves on the screen, along with affecting your yaw in game. This is dumb, and changing your m_yaw value in the source engine also changes your sensitivity so your muscle memory will be messed up. That's no fun, and I'm not hopping on that dumb hype train.
