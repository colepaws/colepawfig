# colepawfig

This is my personal Team Fortress 2 config built for maximum visibility, competitive integrity, and stability in mind.

**NOTE:** This config is completely reliant on [Mastercomfig](https://mastercomfig.com), [Mastercomfigs settings](cfg/overrides/modules.cfg), my [autoexec.cfg](cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg), and my [launch options](cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg#L19), as they include the resolution, optimizations, and security focused Launch Arguments. I also use -dxlevel 95.

**Regarding the [config.cfg:](cfg/config.cfg)** This is probably going to have settings that change per commit, and that's not something to worry about. Loading in game will change and correctly set any values that might get all messed up, since my [autoexec.cfg](cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg) does that.

**Regarding Casual:** I have literally no idea what works and what doesn't with my config, be it mods or settings. I don't play casual so I'm not going to test anything, but be my guest.
